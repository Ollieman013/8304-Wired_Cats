# 🤖 FTC Wired Cats Robotics Code Repository

Welcome to the FTC WiredCats robotics codebase!  
This repository contains Java code for **TeleOp**, **Autonomous**, and **Basic Principles / Learning Files**.  
Everything is organized for clarity, easy editing, and fast development during the season.

## 🕹️ TeleOp

The **TeleOp** folder contains all code used during the driver-controlled period.

Typical files include:
- `MainTeleOp.java` — main driving OpMode  
- `DriveControls.java` — mecanum or tank drive controls  
- `SlideControls.java` — slide motor/arm logic  
- `IntakeControls.java` — intake/outtake code  
- `ServoPositions.java` — preset servo angles  

This section focuses on:
- driver responsiveness  
- button bindings  
- toggles  
- macros  
- motor/servo safety

## 🤖 Autonomous (Auto)

The **Auto** folder contains all autonomous routines and vision code.

Common files:
- `Auto_Left.java`  
- `Auto_Right.java`  
- `Auto_Center.java`  
- Road Runner trajectory sequences  
- AprilTag detection pipelines  

This section focuses on:
- initialization  
- movement sequences  
- scoring cycles  
- camera detection  
- precise motor/servo positioning

## 📘 Basic Principles

The **Basic_Principles** folder holds simplified examples and learning/reference files.

Includes:
- `HardwareMapExample.java`  
- `MotorBasics.java`  
- `ServoBasics.java`  
- `PIDBasics.java`  
- `RoadRunnerBasics.md`  
- `OpModeStructure.md`  

Use this for:
- teaching new programmers  
- testing features before adding to TeleOp/Auto  
- learning how hardware and code connect
